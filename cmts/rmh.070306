It is there:  Statistics/Fit/Best

This has been repaired in both Rcmdr 1.1-7 and in the latest RExcel.
You probably have outdated versions of both.

Two options, both in the short-term future.
a. HH stuff is included of the official Rcmdr.
b. We get Erich to change RExcel to add Rcmdr.HH as an option
   in addition to Rcmdr.
Some variant of b is the right way I think.

I included interaction2wt.  "It is on Graphs/Plot of two-way interactions..."

Not a problem.  As long as you are in the middle of clicking
"Statistics/Fit models/Linear model...", you are constructing a
statement in the menu system.  You can edit it before clicking ok.

The other stuff is easy.  I should be able to do it in July along with
packaging HH.
