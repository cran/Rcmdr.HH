Rich,

Below is the wish list I sent to John Fox in May.  I could accomplish
almost none of this via menu clicking in Rcmdr.HH.  In addition:

Identify points in a scatterplot not just by case id but also by
a qualitative variable already in the dataset, such as a two letter
state abbreviation.  

I no longer see Best Subsets Regression in the menu system.

Get ability to start Rcmdr.HH via menu clicking, not from R Console.  

Become able to start Rcmdr.HH commands from Excel's R Excel menu.
Ultimately, I'd like to get all of Rcmdr.HH's commands into Excel's
menu.

Control size of plot points and their appearance (filled in circle)
Control sizes of labels
Easily being able to label plot points according to an unplotted variable
 in all plots including 3-D
Accept variable names containing embedded blanks (Rich tells me you added
 that feature this spring.  We froze our class use and labs to the
 January version.)
Stack or unstack columns
In regression, plot standardized residuals vs any predictor from the
 regression diagnostics menu. (I know how to do this by adding residuals
 to the data.frame and then using the scatterplot.matrix.)
In regression diagnostics (observation statistics), flag standardized 
 residuals with magnitude exceeding 2.
In regression diagnostics (observation statistics), flag hat-values 
 exceeding 2(p+1)/n
In regression, allow user control over the ordering of predictor 
 variables.  Currently they are placed in alphabetical order.  (Rich
 suggests typing a number next to the variable names in the menu.)
For a two-way or higher-way anova, produce an interaction plot, 
 preferably, one resembling HH's interaction2wt().  (Rich says he
 can do this.)

John Fox:
Why not just use the linear-model dialog, just clicking on the
variables in the order that you want them in the model? Isn't that less
cumbersome?

Burt:
This would be okay.  A disadvantage is that if I change my mind about
the ordering as I'm clicking, I'd have to cancel and start over.
