"Biological Sciences" or something similar is a must.  Alan wouldn't
let me run the session without that.  He perceives the audience as
looking down their noses at Excel and therefore wants a title that is
absolutely clearly directed at people who chose to attend a "Systems
Biology" conference is not directed to a lesser quality of statistics.

An Office-Software- and Menu-Driven Interface to Advanced Statistics in
Biological Sciences

I put the word "Advanced" into your title.

I changed "Approach" to "Interface".  I want to stress that the
statistics is still done by the advanced software.  Only the interface
between the user and the statistics software is through Office.


John Fox will not be at the conference.  It isn't close enough to his
area of interest.  I am not sure how to handle that in the
presentation.  One option is to have your talk include a bit of the
background of the menu system design.

I don't have a biological application.  Naras will be speaking.
Perhaps you could coordinate with him and discuss the interface
between Excel and his work while he discusses the work and why the
interface is useful for his clients.

A third talk I have in mind uses Excel for data management, keeping the
URL of thousands of S-Plus graphs constructed directly from SAS datasets.
He isn't using menus.


I am off to campus after errands.  I will write again in a few hours.
