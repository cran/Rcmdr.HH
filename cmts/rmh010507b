All my answers are with respect to R-2.4.1 and R Commander Version 1.2-6
which I put on your machine last week.

1. Data/Active Data set/stack

See ?stack
See also ?reshape
I think reshape might be a better candidate for a menu.


2.  Would some additional fill-in-the-blank boxes on the right
for cex and perhaps some others be what you want?
I am looking at the
 scatterplot, scatterplot matrix, XY Conditioning Plot
menus

3. Ambiguous request
a. intervals for coefficients
Models/confidence intervals...

b. intervals for yhat?
Last year's Rcmdr.HH menu has the HH function ci.plot for simple
linear regression on the "Statistics/fit models/confidence interval
plot" menu.  Do you need more than that?

Your note said multiple regression, but that needs serious thinking as
the projection of the intervals for the observed points for y ~ x1 + x2
onto the y by x1 plane is not smooth.  You need to hold x2 constant to get
anything reasonable.  Do you know of anyone who has worked that out?  If so
we can program it.

4. That is easy with the command language.

The scatterplot menu has an "identify points" checkbox.  Is that what
you want?

9.  that is an easy thing to add.
DONE!  Turned out not to be easy as I has thought as I discovered I
designed two functions to recursively call each other.  I programmed
it cleaner.  Please check.


7. There are three menus in which to change the order:
twoWayTable.HH
analyzeTwoWayTable.HH
enterTable.HH

In all three the menu should become

Displays
Observed Frequencies             [check]
Expected Frequencies             [check]
Cell chi-square components       [check]

Cell chi components (residuals)  [empty]
Row percentages                  [empty]
Column Percentages               [empty]
Total Percentages                [empty]

Hypothesis Tests
Chi-square test of independence  [check]
Fisher's exact test              [check]

I should merge these three and have them call a common file for the
analysis menus.


5.  Can you propose what the menu should look like?
Perhaps something like

    number of level(ABCD)
p = ---------------------   ?
    number of level(EFGH)


6. Can you propose what the menu should look like?
Perhaps something like

    number of level(ABCD | group1)  -  number of level(ABCD | group2)
p = ------------------------------     ------------------------------   ?
          total in group1                   


8.  Maybe with an additional menu item on the Data menu.
I am not convinced this is worth the trouble.
