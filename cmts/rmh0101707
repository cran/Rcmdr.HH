1. Commander() has changed.  I have to figure out how to get it to use
my menu and match that technique.
DONE!


2. Spurious warning from R CMD check without telling where it comes from:
In R, the argument of a replacement function which corresponds to the right
hand side must be named 'value'.

I trace it to the line
              if (length(grep("<-", current.line)) > 0){
  -rwxrwxrwx+ 1 rmh mkpasswd 24341 Jan  7 21:47 Commander.HH.R
which is not a function definition.

I changed that line to
            if (length(grep('<-', current.line)) > 0){
but it didn't help.

I eventually dropped the duplicate Commander and the problem went away.
