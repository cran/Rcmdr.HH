Statistics Menu Systems for Scientists

Sophisticated programs for statistical analysis can be very complex.
Good collaboration with scientists requires a software interface
between the working styles of the data collector and interpretor and
the analysis software.  In this session we describe and illustrate a
menu system integrated into the Excel menu bar that gives complete
access to the full power of R.  Excel is an ubiquitous spreadsheet
often used for data collection, manipulation, and storage.  References
to arbitrarily large and complex items can be stored in the
spreadsheet cells.  R is an integrated suite of software facilities
for data manipulation, calculation, statistical analysis, and
graphical display.  The R command language can be daunting for an
occasional user who needs access to the computational power of the
language.  This session includes discussions of a newly created system
that allows substantial access to R via a clickable menu residing on
the spreadsheet bar of Microsoft Excel.  Results from the analyses can
be returned to the spreadsheet.  The presentations discuss the
development, implementation and applications of this new technology.
