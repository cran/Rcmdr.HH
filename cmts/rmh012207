Menu Systems for Scientists

Biologists collect data.  Statisticians design and execute analyses.
Communication of data and results between the two groups needs to be
in a form as close as possible to the style in which the biologist is
comfortable.  Many scientists store their data in spreadsheets and
would like the results of their analyses in the same format.  Data in
this setting can be as simple as numbers or as complex as URL's into a
library of JPEG files.  A good interface between a data storage
mechanism such as Excel and a data analysis system is a menu on the
spreadsheet menu bar that generates arbitrarily complex calls to
sophisticated analyses written in R or S-Plus or SAS.
