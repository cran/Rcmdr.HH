Menu Systems for R

R is an elaborate system for.... (one or two sentences).  Few
biologists or researchers in other disciplines who do sophisticated
statistical analyses are capable or comfortable with using the R
Command language.  This session includes discussions of a newly
created system that allows substantial access to R via a clickable
menu emanating from the spreadsheet bar of Microsoft Excel.  The
presentations discuss the development, implementation and applications
of this new technology.
