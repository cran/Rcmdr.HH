Subject: list of needed additions to f06 version of Rcmdr 
To: rmh@temple.edu 


Here is a list of needed additions to the version of Rcmdr I used in f06.

1.  Ability to stack columns without using command language.
2.  Ability to control cex in scatterplots and sploms without using command
    language.
3.  Ability to produce CI's  and PI's in multiple regression without using
    command language.
4.  Ability to label points on a scatterplot with more than just case number.
    For example, if there is a column containing two letter state 
    abbreviations, label the states.  For Olympic data where each case is a
    country, label each point with a short country abbreviation.
5.  When inferring about a single population proportion p, provide the 
    ability to specify which of the two categories relate to p (as opposed
    to 1-p).  In Keller, sometimes yes-no is coded 1-2 and at other times 
    is coded 2-1.
6.  When inferring about two proportions, it is assumed the direction of
    difference between the proportions is leftmost column minus rightmost
    column.  If students examine output rather than generate it from an
    xls, the direction needs to be made clearer in the output.
7.  When analyzing two-dimensional contingency tables, I want the output
    in this order:  a table of observed frequencies, a table of expected
    frequencies assuming the two dimensions are independent, and a table
    of cell contributions to chi-square.  Currently, the table of 
    expected frequencies is last.  Also, on the click menu, make the
    expected frequencies higher on the list than cell chi-square.
8.  When viewing a data set (click on View data set), allow for control of
    number of digits used for certain entries.  
9.  In Best Subsets Regression (HH) output, add an additional column for
    Standard Error of Estimate as a criterion.  Also enable the plot and
    selection of best models to be according to this criterion.
