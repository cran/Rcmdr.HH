0.  I've been in touch with Erich and he has given me some good advice
on Vienna.

1.  Users of Student Minitab in Stat 22 don't use ANY command
language.  That's our goal for Rcmdr for Stat 22.  Reshape might be a
better candidate for a menu provided we don't need to discuss more
than 2 or 3 of its arguments.

2.  Would some additional fill-in-the-blank boxes on the right for cex
and perhaps some others be what you want?  Yes

3.  Currently I do stuff in the command window like

predict(RegModel.1, newdata=data.frame(Odometer=40000), interval="confidence")

This is a model for car price as a function of Odometer.  If I had a
second predictor, Age, I have to revise in the command window to
(Odometer=40000, Age=4).  I want to do all of this stuff by clicking
given a model that contains Price, Odometer and Age.  For multiple
regression, I'm not interested in a CI or PI plot, only the numerical
interval.

4.  The scatterplot menu has an "identify points" checkbox.  Is that what
you want?

Yes.  Currently this checkbox simply gives the case number.  I want it
to be able to give it state or country abbreviations if such a
non-numerical variable is in the dataset.
